Authors: Nina Ebensperger, Karina Martinez, Edison Murairi
## Dataset
Brain MRI scans from OASIS1 dataset.
## Models
1. Gated MLP
2. ResNet50 with Metadata
3. CNN with Attention Mechanism
## Tutorial
1. Download the `Codes` folder
2. Ensure the files `data.csv`,`download_data.py`, `main_code.py` and `run.sh` are present
2. In the terminal, execute the command `./run.sh`
3. Then, the `main_code.py` will execute and train all the three models.

Note: At any time of the training, press `CTRL-C` to interrupt a model and go to the next one.
