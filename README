FINAL PROJECT

## Dataset Download

To download the dataset, you need to set up the Kaggle API:

1. Create a Kaggle account or log in if you already have one.
2. Go to your account settings and download your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`).
3. Place the `kaggle.json` file in the `~/.kaggle` directory on your machine.

After setting up the Kaggle API, run the following command to download the dataset:

```bash
python download_dataset.py


### Note
- The users need to have the Kaggle API installed (`pip install kaggle`).
- Ensure the script and instructions are clear and easy to follow.
